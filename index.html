        <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
        <p>An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force</p>
        <h3>Two Clauses and a Condition</h3>
        <p>There are two clauses or parts to this statement - one that predicts the behavior of stationary objects and the other that predicts the behavior of moving objects. The two parts are summarized in the following diagram.</p>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="image" style="width:500px;height:600px;" />
        <p>
            The behavior of all objects can be described by saying that objects tend to "keep on doing what they're doing" (unless acted upon by an unbalanced force).
            If at rest, they will continue in this same state of rest. If in motion with an eastward velocity of 5 m/s, they will continue in this same state of motion (5 m/s, East).
            If in motion with a leftward velocity of 2 m/s, they will continue in this same state of motion (2 m/s, left).
            The state of motion of an object is maintained as long as the object is not acted upon by an unbalanced force.
            All objects resist changes in their state of motion - they tend to "keep on doing what they're doing."
        </p>
        <h3>Everyday Applications of Newton's First Law</h3>
        <p>
            There are many applications of Newton's first law of motion. Consider some of your experiences in an automobile.
            Have you ever observed the behavior of coffee in a coffee cup filled to the rim while starting a car from rest or while bringing a car to rest from a state of motion? Coffee "keeps on doing what it is doing."
            When you accelerate a car from rest, the road provides an unbalanced force on the spinning wheels to push the car forward; yet the coffee (that was at rest) wants to stay at rest.
            While the car accelerates forward, the coffee remains in the same position; subsequently, the car accelerates out from under the coffee and the coffee spills in your lap.
            On the other hand, when braking from a state of motion the coffee continues forward with the same speed and in the same direction, ultimately hitting the windshield or the dash.
            Coffee in motion stays in motion.

                Periodic Table of the Elements
            </h2>
            <p>
                The periodic table (also known as the periodic table of elements) is organized so scientists can quickly discern the properties of individual elements such as their mass, electron number, electron configuration and their unique chemical properties.
                Metals reside on the left side of the table, while non-metals reside on the right. Organizing the elements to help further our understanding was first provided by Dmitri Mendeleev.
                This periodic table of the elements with names, atomic number, symbol and mass is color-coded for easier reference by students and researchers. For quick reference, go to the periodic table chart with names listed alphabetical order.

        <h2>Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
            A black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City.
            The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
            In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.
        </p>
        <img src="blackhole.jpg" alt="blackhole image" style="width:500px;height:600px;" />
        <p>
            The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries.
            Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core.
            If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, the equations showed, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.

        <h2>Current and Voltage</h2>
        <h3>Electricity</h3>
        <p>Electricity is the natural phenomenon that occurs due to the elementary charge of electrons (negative) and it is linked to the motion or stillness of the charge.</p>
        <img src="Electric_Energy.jpg" alt="image" />
        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>
            “Electric current” is the term that is used to describe electric charge movement from any carrier such as electrons, protons or ions. The electric current is defined by the amount of electric charge that passes through an electric circuit per unit of time
        </p>
        <img src="what-is-electric-current.jpg" alt="image" />
        <h2>Voltage</h2>
        <p>
            “Voltage is the pressure from an electrical circuit’s power source that pushes charged electrons (current) through a conducting loop, enabling them to do work such as illuminating a light.“
